programming an arduino board
this is aimed at making use of arduino board for different project testing it with different electronic component and observing there behaviour whereby some serve as an input device for the srduino amd some serve as output device, which also act as dependent and independent components
learning bit bit in other to later combine all the learning for project
and later going further into integrating it with IOT.
